      <h3>About Our Website</h3>
      <h5>
        Our website was made to help all those students out there who are
        struggling to keep up with their revision, and also for students like
        us, whose notes seem to have fast-running legs and hide-and-seek champion brains for reasons we cannot understand.
        This website was our end-year coding project, which was given by
        EchoedLabs after a year of weekly coding classes. Our website provides
        notes for various subjects in the lower secondary level. Not to worry,
        we will gradually add more subjects and subsequently, the upper
        secondary level. We really hope our website helps you in your revision.
        Do share our website with others hehe! Thank you!
